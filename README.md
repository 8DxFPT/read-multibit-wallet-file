A simple command line tool that exports the private Keys from a Multibit
wallet file. The reason this tool exists is because Multibit is out of
date and has known bugs. Exporting the private keys or wallet words from
Multibit and importing them into another wallet may be the only
effective way to access your funds.

Installation
============
1. Install node version 6 or higher. You can get it from
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Open a command prompt and install this utility:
   ```npm install -g mbexport```

Now you are ready to export the private keys from your wallet.
